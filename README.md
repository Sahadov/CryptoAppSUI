This app allows you to get current information about a range of cryptocurrencies.

The app is made with SwiftUI relying on MVVM architecture.

The network is realised with the use of Combine.

The data persistence is done by CoreData.

All the changes through the app are animated.

The detail screen provides the user with a graph of the currency changes over the recent time.
